This is a free c.ai plus site that works even when c.ai is down.

This is a lightly modified package of (https://www.npmjs.com/package/node_characterai)[This package] so all credits go to the owner.

You will also need puppeteer installed so run
```
npm i puppeteer@latest
```
in your terminal.

How to host it:
run api.js thats in the api folder

then open index.html in public

yea that should be it.
the css is very ugly since i was too lazy and the css is pasted with chatgpt lol.
fixing the uglyness later.
